## App Brainstorming 

1. **Instagram**  
   - Ability to delete old messages  
   - Reels and short videos

2. **Messenger**  
   - Chat themes for each conversation  
   - Ability to react to each other's' messages with emojis

3. **Spotify**  
   - Personalized playlists like Discover Weekly  
   - Making a blend

**App Idea:**  
I’d like to build a **Game Organizer**, a social scheduling app for multiplayer gamers to easily find people to play with and coordinate fun gaming sessions.
The app focuses on multiplayer games that are more enjoyable with friends such as competitive or co-op games or even tournaments for games like FIFA or Rocket League.
 Users can:  
- Join channels for specific games they play  
- Post availability and look for other players.  
- Chat within each channel to coordinate matches or tournaments  
- Set up recurring play sessions for regular game nights
